## 🔄 How to Restore Original Functionality:

### Option 1: Manual Restoration

**In `signin.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Remove these lines:
router.replace('/dashboard');
return;

// Uncomment the block below starting with:
/* 
// Validation
if (!email.trim() || !password.trim()) {
  ...
*/
```

**In `signup.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Remove these lines:
router.replace('/dashboard');
return;

// Uncomment the block below starting with:
/*
// Validation
if (!name.trim() || !email.trim() ...
*/
```

### Option 2: Automated Search & Replace

Search for:
```typescript
// 🚧 TEMPORARY: Skip validation and go directly to dashboard
```

And restore the commented code below it.
